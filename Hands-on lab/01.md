## Exercise 1: Continuous Integration

Duration: 40 minutes

After a requirements gathering effort, we find that Fabrikam Medical Conferences has many areas of potential improvement in their development workflow.  Specifically, we conclude that there are a lot of manual tasks that can be automated. Automation potentially mitigates many of the recurring quality and security issues. Also, the dependencies between Fabrikam's developers' work and productivity are reduced. We will begin to address some of these efforts in this exercise to improve developer flow and establish continuous integration practices.

### Task 1: Connect Azure Board with GitHub

1. In your browser open GitHub Marketplace by navigating to the below URL:
  
    ``` 
    https://github.com/marketplace/azure-boards
    ```

2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select `Install it for Free`.
