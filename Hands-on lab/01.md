## Exercise 1: Continuous Integration

Duration: 40 minutes

After a requirements gathering effort, we find that Fabrikam Medical Conferences has many areas of potential improvement in their development workflow.  Specifically, we conclude that there are a lot of manual tasks that can be automated. Automation potentially mitigates many of the recurring quality and security issues. Also, the dependencies between Fabrikam's developers' work and productivity are reduced. We will begin to address some of these efforts in this exercise to improve developer flow and establish continuous integration practices.

### Task 1: Connect Azure Board with GitHub

1. In your browser open GitHub Marketplace by navigating to the below URL:
  
    ``` 
    https://github.com/marketplace/azure-boards
    ```

2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select `Install it for Free`.

   ![The GitHub Application Authorization page.](media/image11.png "GitHub Application Authorization")
   
   **Note**:  If you see the message **Youâ€™ve already purchased this on all of your GitHub accounts**  this indicates Azure Boards integration is already used in your account.  You can skip step 2-3.

3. On the next page, select `Complete order and begin installation`.

4. Select the lab files repository created in [Task 1 of the Before the HOL Instructions](./Before%20the%20HOL.md#task-1-create-the-project-repo) and select `Install & Authorize`.

    **Note**: If you have already used Azure Boards integration follow the below steps:
    
    - On the Azure Boards page click on **grant this app access to your GitHub account**.
    
    - In the **Repository Access** section, choose your repository and hit Save. 
    

5. Select the Azure DevOps organization you signed into or created in the Before Hands-On Lab setup guide and select the Fabrikam project.

    ![The Azure DevOps Integration Configuration form.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step5-1.png "Azure DevOps Integration Configuration")

6. When the integration succeeds, you will be taken to the Azure DevOps Board. Follow the directions in the onboarding tutorial to create an initial Issue in the `To Do` Column and create a pull request associated with your Issue.

    ![After completion of the onboarding tutorial. Two todo confirmation messages displayed.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step6-1.png "Get started and quick tip")

7. Open the new Issue that the onboarding tutorial creates and observe the GitHub pull request and comment that are linked to the Azure DevOps board Issue.

    ![Linked GitHub items in an Azure DevOps issue in Boards.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step7-1.png "GitHub Pull Request and Comment")

8. In GitHub, browse to the `Pull Requests` tab of the lab files repository created in [Task 1 of the Before the HOL Instructions] and open the pull request that was created in the onboarding tutorial for the Azure Boards Integration App. Note the `AB#1` annotation in the pull request comments - this annotation signals to Azure DevOps that this pull request comment should be linked to Issue #1 in Azure Boards.

    ![Pull request detail in GitHub created by onboarding tutorial in previous steps.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step8-1.png "Pull Request detail")

9. Select the `Files changed` tab within the pull request detail and observe the change to the README.md associated with this pull request. After reviewing the changes, go back to the `Conversation` tab and select the `Merge pull request` button and confirm the following prompt to merge the pull request into the `main` branch.

    ![The file changes associated with the pull request.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step9-1.png "Pull Request Files Changed tab")

10. In Azure DevOps Boards, find the work item and observe that the issue has been moved to the `Done` column on completion of the pull request.

    ![The Pull Request Merge Button in the Pull Request detail.](media/hol-ex1-task2-step6-2.png "Pull Request Merge Button")

7. Pull the latest changes from your GitHub repository to your local GitHub folder.

    ```pwsh
    cd C:\Workspaces\lab\mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files  # This path may vary depending on how
                                                            # you set up your lab files repository
    git pull
    ```

### Task 3: Set up Local Infrastructure

1. Replace instances of `<yourgithubaccount>` with your GitHub account name in the following files located in the root of your lab files repository.
    - `docker-compose.init.yml`
    - `docker-compose.yml`

2. Build and run the docker-compose YAML files edited in the previous step.

    ```pwsh
    docker-compose -f .\docker-compose.yml -f .\local.docker-compose.yml -f .\docker-compose.init.yml build
    docker-compose -f .\docker-compose.yml -f .\local.docker-compose.yml -f .\docker-compose.init.yml up
    ```

3. Verify that you can browse to http://localhost:3000 in a browser and arrive at the Fabrikam conference website.

    ![The docker-compose log output observed when running `docker-compose up` on our docker-compose harness.](media/hol-ex1-task3-step3-2.png "docker-compose log output")

4. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.

### Task 4: Build Automation with GitHub Registry

1. Select the `Settings` tab from your lab files repository in GitHub.

2. Select the `Secrets` blade from the left navigation bar.

    ![The GitHub Repository Settings tab.](media/hol-ex1-task4-step2-1.png "GitHub Repository Settings")

3. Select the `New repository secret` button.

    ![The GitHub Repository Secrets we will create a new repository secret here used in a later step.](media/hol-ex1-task4-step3-1.png "GitHub Repository Secrets")

4. Enter the name `CR_PAT` in the `New secret` form and set the GitHub Personal Access Token we created in the Before the Hands-On Lab instructions.

    ![The New secret form where we create the `CR_PAT` secret.](media/hol-ex1-task4-step4-1.png "New secret form")

5. Select the `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository, find the `Publish Docker Container` workflow and select `Set up this workflow`.

    ![The Publish Docker Container workflow that defines the series of GitHub actions used to build and push a docker container to a GitHub Container Registry.](media/hol-ex1-task4-step5-1.png "Publish Docker Container workflow")

6. Rename the file to `fabrikam-web.yml`.

7. Change the image name to `fabrikam-web` and the registry to `docker.pkg.github.com/<githubaccountname>/<githubreponame>`. This is the name of the container image that will be pushed to the GitHub Container Registry.

    ```yaml
    env:
      # Use docker.io for Docker Hub if empty.
      REGISTRY: docker.pkg.github.com/<githubaccountname>/<githubreponame>
      # github.repository as <account>/<repo>
      IMAGE_NAME: fabrikam-web
    ```

    > **Note**: Make sure to replace `<githubaccountname>` with your GitHub account name and `<githubreponame>` with the name of your GitHub lab files repository. (`docker.pkg.github.com/hatboyzero/mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files` for example)

8. Add explicit path to `Dockerfile` and context path to the `Build and push Docker image` step. This will ensure that the correct `Dockerfile` file can be found.

    ```yaml
    # Build and push Docker image with Build (do not push on PR)
    # https://github.com/docker/build-push-action
    - name: Build and push Docker image
      working-directory: content-web
      uses: docker/build-push-action@ad44023a93711e3deb337508980b4b5e9bcdc5dc
      with:
        file: ./content-web/Dockerfile                      # <-- Add these
        context: ./content-web                              # <-- two lines
        push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
        tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
        labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
    ```

9. Commit the file to the repository.

10. The GitHub Action is now running and will automatically build and push the container to GitHub registry.

    ![Detail of running Docker workflow.](media/hol-ex1-task4-step10-2.png "GitHub Action Detail")

11. Set up workflows for `content-api` and `content-init` in the same manner. Call them `fabrikam-api.yml` and `fabrikam-init.yml` respectively and change the container names to `fabrikam-api` and `fabrikam-init`, respectively.

12. Navigate to the `Packages` tab in your GitHub account and verify that the container images have been built and pushed to the container registry.

    ![GitHub Packages tab listing summary of container images that have been pushed to the container registry.](media/hol-ex1-task4-step12-1.png "GitHub Packages")

13. Pull the latest changes from your GitHub repository.
