## Exercise 1: Continuous Integration

Duration: 40 minutes

After a requirements gathering effort, we find that Fabrikam Medical Conferences has many areas of potential improvement in their development workflow.  Specifically, we conclude that there are a lot of manual tasks that can be automated. Automation potentially mitigates many of the recurring quality and security issues. Also, the dependencies between Fabrikam's developers' work and productivity are reduced. We will begin to address some of these efforts in this exercise to improve developer flow and establish continuous integration practices.

### Task 1: Connect Azure Board with GitHub

1. In your browser open GitHub Marketplace by navigating to the below URL:
  
    ``` 
    https://github.com/marketplace/azure-boards
    ```

2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select `Install it for Free`.

6. When the integration succeeds, you will be taken to the Azure DevOps Board. In the onboarding tutorial click on **Create** to create an initial Issue in the `To Do` Column.

    ![After completion of the onboarding tutorial. Two todo confirmation messages displayed.](media/image14.png "Get started and quick tip")
    
7. Now click on **Create and link a pull request** to create a pull request associated with your Issue.

    ![After completion of the onboarding tutorial. Two todo confirmation messages displayed.](media/image15.png "Get started and quick tip")

8. Open the new Issue that the onboarding tutorial creates and observe the GitHub pull request and comment that are linked to the Azure DevOps board Issue.

    ![Linked GitHub items in an Azure DevOps issue in Boards.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step7-1.png "GitHub Pull Request and Comment")

9. In GitHub, browse to the `Pull Requests` tab of the lab files repository created in [Task 1 of the Before the HOL Instructions] and open the pull request that was created in the onboarding tutorial for the Azure Boards Integration App. Note the `AB#1` annotation in the pull request comments - this annotation signals to Azure DevOps that this pull request comment should be linked to Issue #1 in Azure Boards.

    ![Pull request detail in GitHub created by onboarding tutorial in previous steps.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step8-1.png "Pull Request detail")

10. Select the `Files changed` tab within the pull request detail and observe the change to the README.md associated with this pull request. After reviewing the changes, go back to the `Conversation` tab and select the `Merge pull request` button and confirm the following prompt to merge the pull request into the `main` branch.

    ![The file changes associated with the pull request.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step9-1.png "Pull Request Files Changed tab")

11. In Azure DevOps Boards, find the work item and observe that the issue has been moved to the `Done` column on completion of the pull request.

7. Pull the latest changes from your GitHub repository to your local GitHub folder.

    ```pwsh
    cd C:\Workspaces\lab\mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files  # This path may vary depending on how
                                                            # you set up your lab files repository
    git pull
    ```

### Task 3: Set up Local Infrastructure

   > **Note**: Make sure the Docker Desktop is in Running state as shown in the below screenshot, If not close Docker Desktop from the Task Bar/Task Manager. Then Re-start Docker Desktop from Desktop and wait for 2-5 mins to Docker Desktop get Started.
   
   ![The Docker Desktop Status before performing the task.](media/Docker-Desktop-Status.png "Docker Desktop Status")

1. In your Labvm navigate to `C:\Workspaces\lab\mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files` open **docker-compose.init.yml** and replace instances of `<yourgithubaccount>` with your GitHub account name.

1. Similarly in the same path open **docker-compose.yml** and replace instances of `<yourgithubaccount>` with your GitHub account name.

   ![](media/imageupdate2.png)

4. Now in PowerShell build and run the docker-compose YAML files edited in the previous step by running the following command. After 15-20 mins, proceed with the next step to check if you are able to see the website.

    ```pwsh
    docker-compose -f .\docker-compose.yml -f .\local.docker-compose.yml -f .\docker-compose.init.yml build
    docker-compose -f .\docker-compose.yml -f .\local.docker-compose.yml -f .\docker-compose.init.yml up
    ```
    
    > **Note**: If you face an issue while running the above command with respect to GitHub username, update username in lowercase letter and retry the command. 
    
    > If you face an issue while running above command with respect to default daemon configuration, open docker desktop and click on **Troubleshoot icon** at the right corner and select **Restart** to restart the docker desktop. It might take upto 5 minutes for restarting and rerun the command once restart is completed.

      IMAGE_NAME: fabrikam-web
    ```
    
   ![](media/webworkflow.png)

8. Add explicit path to `Dockerfile` and context path to the `Build and push Docker image` step. This step will ensure the correct `Dockerfile` file can be found.

    ```yaml
    # Build and push Docker image with Buildx (don't push on PR)
    # https://github.com/docker/build-push-action
    - name: Build and push Docker image
      id: build-and-push
      uses: docker/build-push-action@ad44023a93711e3deb337508980b4b5e9bcdc5dc
      with:
        file: ./content-web/Dockerfile                      # <-- Add these
        context: ./content-web                              # <-- two lines
        push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
        tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}

14. Rename the file to `fabrikam-api.yml`.

15. Change the image name to `fabrikam-api` and the registry to `ghcr.io/${{ github.actor }}`. This is the name of the container image that will be pushed to the GitHub Container Registry.

    ```yaml
    env:
      # Use docker.io for Docker Hub if empty.
      REGISTRY: ghcr.io/${{ github.actor }}
      # github.repository as <account>/<repo>
      IMAGE_NAME: fabrikam-api
    ```
    
   ![](media/appimage.png)

16. Add explicit path to `Dockerfile` and context path to the `Build and push Docker image` step. This step will ensure the correct `Dockerfile` file can be found.

    ```yaml
    # Build and push Docker image with Buildx (don't push on PR)
    # https://github.com/docker/build-push-action
    - name: Build and push Docker image
      id: build-and-push
      uses: docker/build-push-action@ad44023a93711e3deb337508980b4b5e9bcdc5dc
