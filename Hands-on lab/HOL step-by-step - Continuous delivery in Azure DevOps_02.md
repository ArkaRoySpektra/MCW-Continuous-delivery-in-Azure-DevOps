## Overview

Tailspin Toys has asked you to automate their development process in two specific ways. First, they want you to define an Azure Resource Manager template that can deploy their application into the Microsoft Azure cloud using Platform-as-a-Service technology for their web application and their PostgreSQL database. Second, they want you to implement a continuous delivery process that will connect their source code repository into the cloud, automatically run their code changes through unit tests, and then automatically create new software builds and deploy them onto environment-specific deployment slots so that each branch of code can be tested and accessed independently.
